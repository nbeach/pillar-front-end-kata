# Pillar Front End Kata

### Requirements
- Node.js v6.9.1 or higher

### Building the project
To build the project you first need to install the needed Node packages by executing the command `npm install` from the 
project directory.

You can then build the project using `npm run build`. The built files are output to `dist/`

You can also build the project using `npm run build:watch` which will watch the source files and re-build the project 
whenever a source file changes. It also launches a development server on port 8080 that automatically refreshes the 
browser when a file is changed. This allows for a fast feedback cycle and rapid iteration.
